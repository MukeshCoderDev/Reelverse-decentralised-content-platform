# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Reelverse18 transforms the existing Reelverse content platform into a decentralized adult content ecosystem while preserving all current UI/UX and functionality. The enhancement adds blockchain-powered features including Web3 wallet integration (already implemented), creator verification, content monetization, and compliance systems. The platform leverages Polygon PoS for transparent transactions, USDC for payments, and implements comprehensive age verification and content protection mechanisms. The system prioritizes creator ownership (90% revenue share), user privacy, and regulatory compliance while maintaining the existing YouTube/TikTok-style interface and all current features.
