# Design Document

## Overview

This design adds wallet connection functionality to the mobile header by integrating the existing WalletButton component into the MobileHeader component. The solution leverages the already-implemented multichain wallet system and simply extends it to the mobile interface.

## Architecture

The design follows the existing wallet architecture pattern:

```
MobileHeader Component
├── Existing buttons (menu/back, search, notifications)
├── NEW: WalletButton Component (reused from desktop)
└── Responsive layout management
```

The implementation will reuse the existing:
- `WalletButton` component (already built)
- `WalletConnectModal` component (already built)  
- `WalletContext` and `useWallet` hook (already implemented)
- All wallet services and utilities (already implemented)

## Components and Interfaces

### Modified Components

#### MobileHeader Component
- **Location**: `components/mobile/MobileHeader.tsx`
- **Changes**: Add WalletButton to the right side button group
- **Layout**: Maintain existing responsive design while accommodating the new button

### Component Integration

The WalletButton component will be imported and used directly in MobileHeader:

```typescript
import { WalletButton } from '../wallet/WalletButton';

// In the right side button group:
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <WalletButton variant="ghost" size="sm" />
  {/* existing search and notification buttons */}
</div>
```

## Data Models

No new data models are required. The existing wallet state management through WalletContext will be used:

- `isConnected`: Boolean for connection status
- `account`: Connected wallet address
- `chainId`: Current network chain ID
- `balance`: Wallet balance (optional display)
- `isConnecting`: Loading state during connection

## Error Handling

Error handling will be managed by the existing WalletButton component and WalletContext:

- Connection failures: Displayed through the existing error state in WalletButton
- Network switching errors: Handled by existing wallet error handling
- Modal interaction errors: Managed by WalletConnectModal component

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test MobileHeader renders WalletButton correctly
- Test button positioning and responsive behavior
- Test integration with existing header buttons

### Integration Tests  
- Test wallet connection flow on mobile
- Test wallet state persistence across mobile navigation
- Test modal display and interaction on mobile screens

### Visual Tests
- Test button layout on various mobile screen sizes
- Test button styling consistency with existing header buttons
- Test dropdown positioning and mobile-friendly interactions

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Component Integration
1. Import WalletButton into MobileHeader
2. Add WalletButton to the right side button group
3. Adjust spacing and layout for proper mobile display

### Phase 2: Styling and Responsive Design
1. Ensure proper button sizing for mobile touch targets
2. Adjust spacing between header buttons
3. Test on various mobile screen sizes

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement
1. Test wallet connection flow on mobile
2. Verify dropdown positioning and mobile usability
3. Ensure no conflicts with existing header functionality

## Design Decisions

### Button Placement
- **Decision**: Place WalletButton as the first button in the right side group
- **Rationale**: Wallet connection is a primary action that should be easily accessible

### Button Styling
- **Decision**: Use `variant="ghost"` and `size="sm"` for mobile
- **Rationale**: Maintains consistency with other mobile header buttons while being touch-friendly

### Responsive Behavior
- **Decision**: Keep wallet button visible on all mobile screen sizes
- **Rationale**: Wallet connection is core functionality that should always be accessible

### Reuse Existing Components
- **Decision**: Reuse existing WalletButton component without modification
- **Rationale**: Maintains consistency, reduces code duplication, and leverages tested functionality
