# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a "Connect Wallet" button to the mobile header interface to provide users with easy access to wallet connection functionality on mobile devices. Currently, the wallet connection is only available through the desktop header, but mobile users need the same convenient access to connect their Web3 wallets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to see a "Connect Wallet" button in the top header, so that I can easily connect my Web3 wallet without navigating to a separate page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the app on mobile THEN the mobile header SHALL display a wallet connection button in the top right area
2. WHEN the wallet is not connected THEN the button SHALL show "Connect Wallet" text with a wallet icon
3. WHEN the wallet is connected THEN the button SHALL show the shortened wallet address with appropriate styling
4. WHEN a user taps the wallet button while disconnected THEN the system SHALL open the wallet connection modal
5. WHEN a user taps the wallet button while connected THEN the system SHALL show a dropdown with wallet management options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the wallet button to fit naturally with the existing mobile header design, so that the interface remains clean and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet button is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain the same visual style as other header buttons
2. WHEN multiple buttons are shown in the header THEN they SHALL be properly spaced and not overlap
3. WHEN the screen size is very small THEN the wallet button SHALL remain accessible and not be hidden
4. WHEN the wallet button is added THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing header functionality (back button, menu, search, notifications)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the wallet connection functionality to work the same as on desktop, so that I have a consistent experience across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects a wallet on mobile THEN the connection SHALL persist across page navigation
2. WHEN a user switches networks on mobile THEN the header button SHALL update to reflect the current network
3. WHEN wallet connection fails on mobile THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN a user disconnects their wallet THEN the button SHALL return to the "Connect Wallet" state
5. WHEN the wallet button dropdown is open THEN tapping outside SHALL close the dropdown
