# AI-Native Features Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines AI-native differentiators that will boost discovery, compliance trust, and ROI for the decentralized adult platform. These features are designed to make agencies actively seek out the platform by providing automated intelligence that reduces manual work while increasing revenue and compliance confidence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI Auto-Tagging and Semantic Search

**User Story:** As an agency, I want my content to be automatically tagged and easily discoverable through semantic search, so that I can increase sales without additional manual tagging work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically generate tags using CLIP/BLIP2 embeddings with 95%+ accuracy
2. WHEN users search for content THEN the system SHALL return semantically relevant results using vector search (pgvector/Weaviate) combined with Meilisearch hybrid search
3. WHEN comparing search performance THEN click-through rates SHALL show measurable uplift versus keyword-only baseline
4. WHEN processing 10 seed queries THEN the system SHALL return relevant results for all queries within 2 seconds
5. WHEN auto-tagging content THEN the system SHALL preserve existing manual tags while adding AI-generated tags
6. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL show relevance scores and tag confidence levels

### Requirement 2: AI Leak Patrol and Off-Platform Detection

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want automated detection of my leaked content across tube sites and social platforms, so that I can protect my revenue without manually monitoring the internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is published THEN the system SHALL generate robust video fingerprints using framewise pHash and audio chroma analysis
2. WHEN crawling tube sites and social platforms THEN the system SHALL detect 80%+ of seeded test leaks within 24 hours
3. WHEN a leak is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically create a takedown case with links, screenshots, and pHash match scores
4. WHEN generating DMCA notices THEN the system SHALL auto-draft takedown requests with evidence from the compliance system
5. WHEN leak detection occurs THEN the system SHALL send webhook notifications to the moderation system
6. WHEN processing fingerprints THEN the system SHALL handle video format variations and compression artifacts

### Requirement 3: AI Compliance Assistant and Evidence Pack Generation

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want an AI assistant that assembles evidence packs and validates consent completeness, so that we can pass audits faster and with greater confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting an evidence pack THEN the system SHALL assemble complete documentation in under 30 seconds
2. WHEN validating consent THEN the system SHALL flag anomalies including mismatched IDs, missing participants, and geo rule violations
3. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN the system SHALL create one-click PDF exports with Merkle hash verification on-chain
4. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL provide risk scores based on compliance completeness
5. WHEN detecting violations THEN the system SHALL automatically flag content for human review
6. WHEN assembling evidence THEN the system SHALL include all required 2257 documentation and consent records

### Requirement 4: Gasless Purchases and Passkey Wallets

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to purchase content without dealing with gas fees or complex crypto wallets, so that I can complete purchases quickly and easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making USDC purchases THEN the system SHALL complete transactions without showing gas fee popups using Permit2 and ERC-2771/AA paymaster
2. WHEN signing up THEN users SHALL complete email/passkey registration in under 15 seconds using embedded wallet solutions
3. WHEN A/B testing checkout flows THEN gasless purchases SHALL show +15% completion rate improvement
4. WHEN using passkey wallets THEN the system SHALL support Privy/Biconomy/Thirdweb integration
5. WHEN processing payments THEN the system SHALL maintain existing revenue splitting functionality
6. WHEN handling wallet creation THEN the system SHALL provide seamless fallback to traditional wallet connection

### Requirement 5: Real-time Quality and Business SLOs on Public Dashboard

**User Story:** As an agency evaluating platforms, I want to see real-time performance metrics and business SLOs on a public dashboard, so that I can trust the platform runs with professional operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring playback quality THEN the system SHALL display live p95 join time and rebuffer ratio on the public status page
2. WHEN tracking business metrics THEN the system SHALL show payout processing latency (p95) in real-time
3. WHEN performance thresholds are breached THEN the system SHALL trigger webhooks and alerts automatically
4. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL update player beacons for start/rebuffer/error events in real-time
5. WHEN agencies visit the status page THEN they SHALL see uptime statistics and operational transparency
6. WHEN comparing to competitors THEN the metrics SHALL demonstrate professional-grade reliability and performance
