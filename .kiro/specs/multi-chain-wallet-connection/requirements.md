# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive multi-chain Web3 wallet connection system for the Reelverse platform. The system will enable users to connect their preferred wallets across multiple blockchain networks, providing seamless access to Web3 functionality including transactions, NFT interactions, and DeFi features. The implementation will support six major blockchain networks and six popular wallet providers, creating a universal gateway for Web3 interactions within the Reelverse ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my wallet to the Reelverse platform, so that I can access Web3 features and manage my digital assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Connect Wallet" button THEN the system SHALL display a modal with available wallet options
2. WHEN a user selects a wallet provider THEN the system SHALL initiate the connection process for that specific wallet
3. WHEN a wallet connection is successful THEN the system SHALL store the connection state and display the connected wallet address
4. WHEN a wallet connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry
5. IF a user is already connected THEN the system SHALL display the connected wallet information instead of the connect button

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between different blockchain networks, so that I can interact with assets and contracts on my preferred chain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is connected to a wallet THEN the system SHALL display the current active network
2. WHEN a user clicks the network selector THEN the system SHALL show all supported blockchain networks (Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche)
3. WHEN a user selects a different network THEN the system SHALL request the wallet to switch to that network
4. IF the selected network is not added to the user's wallet THEN the system SHALL prompt to add the network with correct RPC details
5. WHEN network switching is successful THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the new active network

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my wallet balance and basic account information, so that I can verify my connection and monitor my assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wallet is successfully connected THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the native token balance for the active network
2. WHEN the network is switched THEN the system SHALL update the displayed balance for the new network
3. WHEN displaying wallet information THEN the system SHALL show a shortened version of the wallet address with copy functionality
4. WHEN a user clicks the wallet address THEN the system SHALL copy the full address to clipboard and show confirmation
5. IF balance fetching fails THEN the system SHALL display "Unable to fetch balance" with a retry option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to disconnect my wallet when needed, so that I can maintain control over my wallet connections and privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is connected THEN the system SHALL provide a "Disconnect" option in the wallet interface
2. WHEN a user clicks disconnect THEN the system SHALL clear all stored wallet connection data
3. WHEN disconnection is complete THEN the system SHALL return to the initial "Connect Wallet" state
4. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system SHALL clear any cached balance or account information
5. IF disconnection fails THEN the system SHALL still clear local state and show the disconnected UI

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust wallet connection state management system, so that the application can reliably track and respond to wallet connection changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL check for existing wallet connections and restore state if available
2. WHEN a wallet connection state changes THEN the system SHALL emit events that components can subscribe to
3. WHEN a user switches accounts in their wallet THEN the system SHALL detect the change and update the application state
4. WHEN a user locks their wallet THEN the system SHALL detect the disconnection and update the UI accordingly
5. IF a wallet becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and prompt for reconnection

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want support for multiple popular wallet providers, so that I can use my preferred wallet regardless of the provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing wallet options THEN the system SHALL support MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, Trust Wallet, and Rainbow wallet
2. WHEN a user selects MetaMask THEN the system SHALL use the injected ethereum provider if available
3. WHEN a user selects WalletConnect THEN the system SHALL display a QR code for mobile wallet connection
4. WHEN a user selects Coinbase Wallet THEN the system SHALL use the Coinbase Wallet SDK for connection
5. IF a selected wallet is not installed THEN the system SHALL provide installation instructions and download links

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wallet connection to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't need to reconnect every time I visit the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully connects a wallet THEN the system SHALL store the connection preference in local storage
2. WHEN a user returns to the platform THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore the previous wallet connection
3. WHEN auto-reconnection is successful THEN the system SHALL restore the full wallet state including network and balance
4. IF auto-reconnection fails THEN the system SHALL clear stored data and show the connect wallet interface
5. WHEN a user manually disconnects THEN the system SHALL remove all stored connection data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about my wallet connection status, so that I always know whether I'm connected and to which network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL display a prominent "Connect Wallet" button
2. WHEN a wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL show a wallet indicator with network icon and shortened address
3. WHEN a transaction is pending THEN the system SHALL show loading states and transaction status
4. WHEN switching networks THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators during the switch process
5. IF there are connection errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested actions
