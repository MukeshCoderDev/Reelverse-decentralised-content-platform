# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical gaps identified in Reelverse's API to achieve production-grade readiness for a decentralized adult content platform. While the platform has solid foundations in compliance, DMCA, HLS encryption, and key management, it lacks essential components for secure monetization, content protection, and legal compliance at scale.

4. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL link on-chain hashes to off-chain encrypted data stores
5. IF privacy breach is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately rotate salts and update hash generation procedures
6. WHEN compliance review occurs THEN the system SHALL demonstrate zero PII exposure on public blockchain networks
7. WHEN data minimization is validated THEN the system SHALL provide cryptographic proofs of hash-only storage

### Requirement 38: Device Fingerprinting Ethics and Accuracy

**User Story:** As a privacy engineer, I want ethical device fingerprinting with user transparency, so that concurrency enforcement respects user privacy and regional regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN device fingerprinting occurs THEN the system SHALL use canvas, WebGL, audio context, and hardware signals with user consent
2. WHEN fingerprints are processed THEN the system SHALL handle false positives with user-friendly device management options
3. WHEN privacy regulations apply THEN the system SHALL respect EU ePrivacy directive and provide opt-out mechanisms
4. WHEN device limits are enforced THEN the system SHALL default to 2-4 concurrent streams with override policies for families
5. IF jailbroken/rooted devices are detected THEN the system SHALL apply additional security measures without blocking access
6. WHEN NAT/IP collisions occur THEN the system SHALL use additional signals to distinguish legitimate users
7. WHEN transparency is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of fingerprinting methods and user controls

### Requirement 39: Platform Availability and Capacity SLOs

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want explicit availability and capacity SLOs, so that the platform scales reliably under varying load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playback is requested THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.95% availability with P95 startup delay ≤ 3 seconds
2. WHEN uploads are processed THEN the system SHALL achieve P95 upload→preview time ≤ 10 minutes for 2-4GB files
3. WHEN transcoding capacity is needed THEN the system SHALL autoscale with queue latency SLO P95 ≤ 5 minutes
4. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure to maintain SLOs rather than degrading quality
5. IF capacity limits are reached THEN the system SHALL prioritize paying customers and enterprise priority lanes
6. WHEN failure rates exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL maintain transcode failure ≤ 1%, packaging failure ≤ 0.5%
7. WHEN scaling events occur THEN the system SHALL provide capacity planning metrics and cost optimization recommendations

### Requirement 40: Permanent Storage Consent and Risk Disclosure

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want clear consent and risk disclosure for permanent storage options, so that I understand the implications of immutable content storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permanent storage is offered THEN the system SHALL default to shreddable storage with explicit opt-in for permanent
2. WHEN consent is requested THEN the system SHALL provide clear legal disclosure of immutability and compliance implications
3. WHEN permanent storage is selected THEN the system SHALL require additional compliance checks and legal acknowledgment
4. WHEN risk assessment occurs THEN the system SHALL evaluate content type, jurisdiction, and creator verification status
5. IF high-risk content is detected THEN the system SHALL require legal review before permanent storage approval
6. WHEN storage decisions are made THEN the system SHALL document consent with timestamps and legal basis
7. WHEN audit occurs THEN the system SHALL provide evidence of informed consent for all permanent storage decisions

### Requirement 41: Blue Team Operations and Supply Chain Security

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive vulnerability management and incident response capabilities, so that the platform maintains security posture against evolving threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain SBOMs and perform continuous vulnerability scanning
2. WHEN secrets are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent commits with secret scanning and automated rotation
3. WHEN incidents occur THEN the system SHALL execute response runbooks with defined RACI and MTTR ≤ 4 hours for critical issues
4. WHEN vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL patch within 72 hours for critical, 7 days for high severity
5. IF supply chain compromise is detected THEN the system SHALL isolate affected components and validate integrity
6. WHEN security assessments occur THEN the system SHALL conduct quarterly penetration testing and annual security audits
7. WHEN threat intelligence is updated THEN the system SHALL incorporate IOCs and update detection rules within 24 hours

### Requirement 42: Regulatory Compliance Matrix

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want region-specific policy templates and regulatory mapping, so that the platform automatically applies appropriate controls per jurisdiction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN regional policies are configured THEN the system SHALL implement US (2257, DMCA, NCMEC), EU (GDPR, AVMSD, DSA), UK (Online Safety Act), CA/AU/JP templates
2. WHEN age verification is required THEN the system SHALL apply jurisdiction-specific requirements (LA, UT, TX, MS state laws; EU age-assurance)
3. WHEN content is categorized THEN the system SHALL apply geo-restrictions, logging retention, and consent review intensity per region
4. WHEN tax obligations apply THEN the system SHALL calculate and collect appropriate taxes for digital services per jurisdiction
