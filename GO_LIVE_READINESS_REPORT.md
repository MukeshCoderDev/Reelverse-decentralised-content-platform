### 📊 **CURRENT STATUS: 85% AGENCY-READY**

**What's Solid:**
- ✅ Core AI-native features that differentiate us from competitors
- ✅ Real-time metrics and operational transparency
- ✅ Advanced anti-piracy and compliance systems
- ✅ Gasless payments and modern UX
- ✅ The Graph subgraph for analytics and partner APIs

**What Needs Immediate Attention:**
- ❌ Legal documentation package (agencies will ask for this)
- ❌ CSAM detection (payment partners require this)
- ❌ Comprehensive E2E testing
- ❌ Security audit and penetration testing

**Recommendation:** Focus on Tasks 70-73 first (legal, compliance, testing) as these are hard blockers for agency partnerships and payment processor relationships. Tasks 74-78 can be completed in parallel or shortly after go-live.
